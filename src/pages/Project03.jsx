            <li>Added a message that appears when the player is close to the panel to give an instruction of how to interact with it. It was also developed with a Physics.OverlapSphere. The message is activated when the player enters the sphere</li>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p className="proj-paragraph">Initially, the goal of this project was to develop a weapon system. However, I continued adding mechanics, which led me to the discovery of several useful techniques. I reached a better understanding of Unity Events. I focused on organization, ensuring each script had a clear purpose and avoiding overly lengthy scripts.
        The most challenging part of this project was developing the enemyâ€™s field of view. I used an online tool to visualize the 3D vectors in order to better understand their direction and angles.
        Finally, I would like to mention that when I was writing the code for the buttons I felt like I was working on a website with javascript. It showed me how knowledge from different fields can be leveraged to find solutions and enhance results.</p>
